# DSA Arrays

This repository contains Python implementations of basic array operations and sorting algorithms, focusing on data structures and algorithms (DSA) concepts.

## Files

- `arrays.py`: Demonstrates basic array operations including finding minimum and maximum values, array length, and element access.
- `bubbleSort.py`: Implements the bubble sort algorithm with detailed comments explaining each step of the sorting process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

Run the scripts directly with Python:

```bash
python arrays.py
python bubbleSort.py
```

### arrays.py
This script creates an array and performs basic operations:
- Prints the array
- Displays the length of the array
- Accesses the first element
- Finds and prints the minimum value
- Finds and prints the maximum value + 1

### bubbleSort.py
This script demonstrates bubble sort:
- Starts with an unsorted array
- Applies bubble sort to sort the array in ascending order
- Prints the sorted array and its length
- Includes detailed comments explaining the algorithm's logic

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic array operations in Python
- Implementing and understanding the bubble sort algorithm
- Time complexity analysis (bubble sort is O(n²))
- Nested loop patterns in sorting algorithms
